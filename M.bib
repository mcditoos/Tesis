abstract = {The optical methods for flow visualization in wind tunnels provide an interesting means of analysis. In order to extend their use, in transonic and supersonic flows, it is necessary to obtain photographs and high-speed pictures and a quantitative interpretation must be possible.Two types of utilized equipment are described.One of them is an interferometer of the horizontal Mach type. The other, called ``interferential schlieren'' apparatus, is the result of the application of the interferential contrast methods developed by Fran\c{c}on and Nomarski at the Institut d'Optique in Paris. In this paper, we describe two optical setups, the first for an over-all study of the flow over a model, the second for a detailed analysis of a small region.Photographs obtained with these devices can be seen. They show how interesting is the interferential schlieren apparatus which permits, in certain cases, a quantitative analysis as precise as that provided by separated beams interferometry, but with a simpler equipment which is easier to handle, less sensitive to external vibrations, and less expensive.},

	abstract = {This book is for those who have some knowledge of optics, but little or no previous experience in interferometry. Accordingly, the carefully designed presentation helps readers easily find and assimilate the interferometric techniques they need for precision measurements. Mathematics is held to a minimum, and the topics covered are also summarized in capsule overviews at the beginning and end of each chapter. Each chapter also contains a set of worked problems that give a feel for numbers.The first five chapters present a clear tutorial review of fundamentals. Chapters six and seven discuss the types of lasers and photodetectors used in interferometry. The next eight chapters describe key applications of interferometry: measurements of length, optical testing, studies of refractive index fields, interference microscopy, holographic and speckle interferometry, interferometric sensors, interference spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform spectroscopy. The final chapter offers suggestions on choosing and setting up an interferometer.},
